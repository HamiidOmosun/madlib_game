# üé≠ MadLibs Game (Python Project)

A fun and interactive command-line game that generates silly, creative stories based on user input ‚Äî all written in Python!

## üìå What is MadLibs?

MadLibs is a word game where users are prompted to provide random words like nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc., which are then inserted into a story template to create a funny or nonsensical story.

## üß† What I Learned

- How to use **functions** in Python
- Working with **user input** and **string formatting**
- Organizing code into **modules** and **importing files**
- Using **random.choice()** to select items

## üïπÔ∏è How It Works

1. The program asks the user to choose (or randomly selects) a story.
2. It prompts for different words (like noun, verb, adjective, etc.).
3. It inserts the words into a story template and prints out the final story.

## üîß How to Run It

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamiidomosun/madlibs_game.git
   cd madlibs-game
